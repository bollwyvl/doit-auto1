Watch filesystem and re-execute on changes.

# Status

This is the *first* generation of `doit` `auto` command.

It is based on:

- Linux: `pyinotify <http://trac.dbzteam.org/pyinotify>`_
- MAC:`macfsevents <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/MacFSEvents>`_

Unfortunately both of this projects are not maintained anymore.
